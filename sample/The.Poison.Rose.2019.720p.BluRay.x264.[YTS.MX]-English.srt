00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,817
<i>My name
is Carson Phillips.</i>

3
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,186
<i>I'm a PI.</i>

4
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:51,259
<i>I like to drink. I like to smoke.
I like to gamble.</i>

5
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,100
<i>Sometimes, a little too much.</i>

6
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,769
<i>But you know what they say.</i>

7
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,537
<i>Everything in moderation.</i>

8
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,307
<i>Including moderation.</i>

9
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,552
<i>I figured I could've
taken these guys, but...</i>

10
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:24,256
<i>last time I had uninvited
guests, they trashed my place</i>

11
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,295
<i>and frankly, Raymond, my cat,
still hasn't gotten over it.</i>

12
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:31,565
Uh-uh.

13
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,266
I'm holding a cat.

14
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:36,468
- What?
- You hold it.

15
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:41,375
Damn it!

16
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,020
Goddamn it!

17
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:58,124
<i>I've been working
in LA for over 20 years.</i>

18
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,592
<i>Whoever named this place
the City of Angels</i>

19
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,130
<i>certainly had a terrific
sense of humor.</i>

20
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,499
<i>Behind all the Hollywood
glitz and glam</i>

21
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,233
<i>it's just like any other city.</i>

22
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:12,436
<i>Except when the Santa Ana
winds blow hot off the desert</i>

23
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,541
<i>and the unimaginable
suddenly turns real.</i>

24
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:16,841
<i>People get a little more jumpy.</i>

25
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:20,647
<i>Their skin starts to crawl.
And parties end with dead bodies.</i>

26
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,115
<i>But I guess
that's entertainment.</i>

27
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:29,355
<i>Most of my jobs
are pretty routine.</i>

28
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:33,359
<i>Cheating spouses, deadbeat
dads, missing persons.</i>

29
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,559
<i>But every once in a while,</i>

30
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,699
<i>a case becomes something
I never saw coming.</i>

31
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,268
You brought Raymond to work.
Who's after you this time?

32
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,869
Well, you only bring Raymond in
when someone's after you

33
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,838
and you gotta hide out.

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,441
Aren't you cute when you're
not minding your own business?

35
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,343
Take him for a few days.

36
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,413
Sure thing, Carson.
By the way, someone's in your office.

37
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,562
I can see that.

38
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,898
Mr. Phillips?

39
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,602
You seem surprised.

40
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,970
I was just expecting
you'd look much older.

41
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:09,538
You almost look like you
could suit up right now.

42
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,977
You must know a little bit about my past.
Have a seat.

43
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,912
I grew up in Galveston.
Oh, well.

44
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:18,915
I thought I caught a little
bit of East Texas in there.

45
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,684
You were something to watch.

46
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,662
Flattery...

47
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,896
It'll get you everywhere.

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,998
I'm yours. How can I help you?

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,736
Well, Mr. Phillips,
my aunt, Barbara Van Poole,

50
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,771
is in a sanitarium
just outside of Galveston.

51
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:43,908
Pleasant Meadows?

52
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:45,876
I remember Pleasant Meadows.

53
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,677
A few years back,
she had a complete nervous breakdown

54
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,947
and she just hasn't
been well ever since.

55
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,583
I used to call and
speak with her regularly,

56
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,985
but now when I phone,
I just get the runaround.

57
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,887
All I get are some
letters in the mail.

58
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,692
Well, you see, I don't typically
do out-of-town jobs, so...

59
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:06,695
Well, it's just that I don't
wanna hire anyone from there

60
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,699
'cause I don't know
if I can trust them.

61
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,467
How do you know
you can trust me?

62
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,469
Hey, Carson.

63
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:17,641
I think it might be a good idea for
you to get out of town for a few weeks.

64
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,775
We're talking about
Galveston here.

65
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:22,977
W-What's wrong with Galveston?

66
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,515
Not a thing. Just not for me.

67
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:33,990
Name your price, Carson.

68
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,302
<i>A beautiful
woman with a sob story</i>

69
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:50,506
<i>has always been
one of my weaknesses.</i>

70
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,076
<i>Along with her having
an open checkbook...</i>

71
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,512
<i>she became irresistible.</i>

72
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,984
<i>The road has always been
a fascinating place for me.</i>

73
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,951
<i>The drone of the tires
against the asphalt</i>

74
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:08,024
<i>becomes this hypnotic chorus taking
me back to places I rarely go.</i>

75
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,070
<i>There I was, back in Texas.</i>

76
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:24,773
<i>The land of cowboys,
beautiful women,</i>

77
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,941
<i>72 ounce steaks...</i>

78
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:28,342
You won't be disappointed
in these steaks.

79
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,277
<i>...and
the holiest of holy.</i>

80
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:44,926
<i>A lot has happened
since I left Texas.</i>

81
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,929
<i>The Beatles and Vietnam
had come and gone,</i>

82
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,965
<i>Armstrong walked on the moon,</i>

83
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,870
<i>and I drank enough bourbon
to fill the Cotton Bowl.</i>

84
00:06:56,905 --> 00:07:00,741
<i>Maybe I drank enough to finally
face the shame of my past.</i>

85
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:05,311
<i>I ran out on Jayne,
the only woman I've ever loved,</i>

86
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,981
<i>faster than I ever
ran on the field,</i>

87
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:11,086
<i>after I disgraced myself
in that fateful final game.</i>

88
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,202
Hello.

89
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,838
We've been expecting you.

90
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,111
You have?

91
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,841
You're here as an observer
from the Institute, aren't you?

92
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,112
Nope. I'm just...

93
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,281
- here to visit a patient.
- A friend?

94
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:17,149
What's your position?
Are you a doctor or something?

95
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,220
No.
Paranoid schizophrenic.

96
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,719
There she is.

97
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,921
I have a cat that's paranoid.

98
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,926
- It's time for session.
- Sorry, sir.

99
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:34,167
<i>Bingo
at 3:30 in the sunroom.</i>

100
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,933
<i>Now, don't forget everyone...</i>

101
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,368
Howdy.
Howdy.

102
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,563
Can I help you?

103
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:42,407
Yeah. I'm here to see a patient of
yours by the name of Barbara Van Poole.

104
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,443
<i>Don't forget,
bingo at 3:30 in the sunroom.</i>

105
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,445
- Something wrong?
- No.

106
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:50,650
That name don't sound familiar.
Can you describe her?

107
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:54,986
Well, she lives here.
I think you'd do a better job than I can.

108
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:57,157
She's probably in your files there.
Just check them.

109
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,261
- I'll get Dr. Mitchell.
- All right.

110
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,235
<i>Group meditation
on the main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

111
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:13,236
<i>There'll be group meditation
on the main lawn...</i>

112
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:16,807
He's really busy right now.
If you don't mind having a seat.

113
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:17,877
All right.

114
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:22,078
Y'all do electric shock
treatment here?

115
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,152
Not to visitors.
Well, that's good news.

116
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:36,226
He's here to
see Barbara Van Poole.

117
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:53,910
<i>Group meditation
on the main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

118
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:57,049
<i>Group meditation on the
main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

119
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:19,338
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Carson Phillips.

120
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:21,939
Excuse me?

121
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,042
Oh, you don't
remember me.

122
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:27,577
It was a long time ago.

123
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,313
I was a freshman,
warming the bench.

124
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:33,082
Still got splinters in my backside
from that. Playing football.

125
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:36,053
You were out on the field.
You were a senior. You...

126
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:40,390
Scoring.
Setting records.

127
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,124
We went to a couple
of classes together.

128
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:43,961
That is,
whenever you showed up.

129
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,428
Miles.

130
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,199
That your name? Miles?

131
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:52,167
- Dr. Miles Mitchell.
- A lot of years ago. A lot of years ago.

132
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,804
- True.
- Yeah.

133
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:58,507
You really could have
been one of the greats.

134
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,578
Mmm. Well,
you sure did well for yourself.

135
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,880
This is a beautiful place you got here.
Thank you very much.

136
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:08,916
We take pride in creating a serene
environment for our clients.

137
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,354
We service all the
greater Galveston area.

138
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:14,089
All over Texas.

139
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,359
The entire nation, really.

140
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,627
So, you're here to
see Miss Van Poole?

141
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,863
Yes, I am.

142
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,099
Right this way.
All right.

143
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,970
Well then, how do you
know Miss Van Poole?

144
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,973
Well, just a friend
of the family's.

145
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,445
I came back to my hometown.
I'm just visiting.

146
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,013
No problem, I trust.

147
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,382
Hey, you're the doctor.
You tell me.

148
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,386
No. No.
Of course not.

149
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,653
It's just that she doesn't
get many visitors

150
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,890
and she rarely sees the family.

151
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,192
Well,
here I am visiting.

152
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,428
Hmm.
Yeah.

153
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,962
I don't like to
neglect a promise,

154
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,632
so I told her
I'd go visit Barbara

155
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,268
and make sure she's all right,
maybe even cheer her up a bit.

156
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,440
Course. Course,
I understand completely.

157
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,275
It's just that you can't
see Barbara right now.

158
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,112
She's in a group
therapy session.

159
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:13,315
- So, how long are you in town?
- Well, I'll wait.

160
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,517
Well, the session
goes on all afternoon

161
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,919
and we don't like to interrupt
them, you see.

162
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:23,357
Of course, we do give them breaks and
such, but we need to keep them... focused.

163
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:27,028
But I will call you when she's up and
around. Now, where are you staying?

164
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,099
Well, why don't I just
come back this evening?

165
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,599
She'll be exhausted,
poor thing.

166
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:36,169
We do like to give the patients
time to reflect upon...

167
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,475
Mm-hmm.
what the group has said.

168
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,176
So...

169
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,977
They didn't tell me about
this group therapy stuff.

170
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,481
I'm curious about that.

171
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,450
Miss Van Poole's
a very private person.

172
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,486
On top of that, she...

173
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,588
is considerably wealthy,
and she has this belief that...

174
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,289
Everybody wants her money.

175
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,392
Well, I can assure you
that ain't the case.

176
00:12:58,394 --> 00:12:59,626
So, why don't we do this?

177
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:02,062
I'm staying at
the Lone Star Motel.

178
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:05,465
Why don't you give me a call when
Barbara's ready, and I'll come back.

179
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:09,236
In the meantime, I say,
thank you for your time

180
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,507
and have a great day.

181
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:56,148
<i>I felt the invisible
tug of my short hairs</i>

182
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,117
<i>when I left
the good doctor,</i>

183
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,288
<i>so I thought I'd follow
a different tug.</i>

184
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,055
<i>♪ Got me in love
Like a criminal ♪</i>

185
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,123
<i>♪ Play me like a guitar
Rock 'n' roll ♪</i>

186
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,163
<i>♪ Roller coaster, high and low
Got me so out of control ♪</i>

187
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:44,764
Hey, you.

188
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,535
- I assume you can still get bourbon here?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,372
You got it.

190
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:59,446
Baby needs a new Camaro!

191

196
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:25,236
For shit's sake, Slide.
Call or get out. Enough already.

197
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,738
Let's go, <i>cabrón.</i>

198
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,340
Only three kind of people
who wear sunglasses inside.

199
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,244
Blind people, assholes
and blind assholes.

200
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,115
Okay, I raise
200 dollars.

201
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,653
Lorenzo, you spend
all your money on that suit?

202
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:41,253
I like that suit.

203
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,456
Oh, my God.

204
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:49,125
Hey, Doc.
How you doing?

205
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,430
I never thought I'd see
you around here again.

206
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,630
Look at you.
You look like hell.

207
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,465
Well, only you'd know.

208
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,733
I like what you've
done to the place.

209
00:15:56,735 --> 00:16:00,269
Well, you know,
they demand, I supply.

210
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,676
They get screwed,
I get rich.

211
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,609
Not very scientific,
but it works every time.

212
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:09,580
- Bing, you remember our hometown hero.
- Oh, come on now!

213
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:10,683
Bing Walsh?

214
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,916
It's Chief Walsh now.

215
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:16,186
Oh! Chief of police.
Oh, man. Only in Texas.

216
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,358
Don't do this! Don't do this!

217
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,829
- I thought I saw a ghost, man.
- You did see a ghost.

218
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:29,702
Deal him in, Mary Sue.
His credit's good around here.

219
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,670
His credit is good.

220
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:40,544
I guess you're up
for a nice, friendly game?

221
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,313
All right. Well, twist my arm.

222
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,885
- Can we play some goddamn cards?
- Hold your horses there, slick.

223
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,657
This is Lorenzo Rodriguez.
He's a...

224
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:53,924
entrepreneur.

225
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,524
Isn't that what
you call yourself?

226
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,462
You know what we call him?
El Guano.

227
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:02,467
'Cause he used to clean out
the bedpans at the sanitarium.

228
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,202
Is that right?

229
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,836
You're the man
I need to talk to.

230
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,772
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hi, angel. How much you need?

231
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,643
What? Just your
love and affection.

232
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:15,511
Carson, this is my daughter, Rose.
She owns this joint.

233
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,713
Oh. It's impressive.
Thank you.

234
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:20,215
- And this is...
- Oh, I know who he is.

235
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,985
'Cause I watch you
every week on TV.

236
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:24,753
How's it feel to have
all your records broken?

237
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,691
Oh, man,
that's what they're made for.

238
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,558
Coach said you used to be the
best quarterback he ever saw.

239
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,559
Well, I bet he ain't
saying that no more.

240
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:32,895
You got that right.

241
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,663
What a screwup, huh?

242
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,998
Oh? We're insulting now?

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,702
I mean, betting on your own
games, shaving points.

244
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:42,972
Man, you had the world by the balls,
and you just threw it all away.

245
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,639
How's that make you feel?

246
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,677
I don't know.
Maybe one day you'll tell me.

247
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,647
That's not likely.
I don't have a price, old man.

248
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:53,450
- Everybody's got a price.
- So much talk.

249
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:56,418
Yeah. I'm way down here.

250
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,622
Happy, I'll see you later
in my office.

251
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,624
See you around, Carson.

252
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,959
All right, slick,

253
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,294
let's see what you learned
in the big city.

254
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,764
- All right.
- Ante up, gentlemen.

255
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:29,486
Fuck. Are you kidding me?
Fuck it.

256
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:43,664
<i>So there I was,
sitting at a poker table,</i>

257
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,400
<i>surrounded by the people
I grew up with.</i>

258
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:49,436
<i>And even though I'd been
gone for over 20 years,</i>

259
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:50,872
<i>I couldn't believe how easily</i>

260
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,944
<i>I slipped back into the pace
and rhythm of my past.</i>

261
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:59,079
<i>There was Bing Walsh,
who I played football with.</i>

262
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:02,683
<i>I was certain the next big case
he saw would be his first.</i>

263
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:03,719
I'm done.

264
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,492
- I'm all in.
- He's all in.

265
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:15,329
<i>Then there was
Slide, the original hippy.</i>

266
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,666
<i>He probably dropped more acid
than Timothy Leary.</i>

267
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,335
Sorry, Doc. I'm outta here.

268
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,607
- All in.
<i>- Lastly, there was Doc.</i>

269
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,876
<i>He went from being
a small-town bookie</i>

270
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,379
<i>to one of the biggest
power brokers in the state.</i>

271
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,414
- <i>That in itself had to be respected...</i>
- <i>Chinga!</i>

272
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,487
<i>considering he was a black man...
in Texas.</i>

273
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,295
Only the big dogs left.

274
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,534
- Possible straight.
- Check.

275
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,037
You know me, Doc.
All or nothing.

276
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:02,577
That line of thinking tends to
lead more towards nothing...

277
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,513
than something.

278
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:06,948
Call.

279
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:09,884
We live in a world
that's full of risk.

280
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:12,653
That makes a straight.

281
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,660
I don't.

282
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,796
Doc wins.
Congratulations.

283
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,696
Full house beats a straight.

284
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,334
I never lose, Carson.

285
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:31,170
- Mary Sue, cash those chips in for me.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:33,640
Let's take a break. I'll buy you a drink.
Bourbon, isn't it?

287
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,042
Yep.

288
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,715
Really sorry
to hear about Marie.

289
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,588
Been 12 years now.

290
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:52,359
Fucking cancer.
Mmm.

291
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,562
Nearly half the town
got sick with it.

292
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,633
You seen Jayne yet?

293
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,134
No. No.

294
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,605
Oh, hell, I wouldn't know
what to say to her.

295
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,439
She's a widow now.

296
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:10,143
Got a beautiful daughter, Becky.

297
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,745
- Married to that idiot.
- I still got guys behind me.

298
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:19,686
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, hell, here we go.

299
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,822
- Chill out, man.
- Hey, hey, Happy.

300
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:25,993
Now, all right!

301
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,493
The hell's the matter with you?

302
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:33,064
Starting a fistfight on the night before
a big game. Have you lost your mind?

303
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,433
Go home to your wife.

304
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,536
Look. You take a swing at
me and I can assure you,

305
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:39,971
you'll lose your spot
for the draft.

306
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:40,874
You understand?

307
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:42,808
Settle down.

308
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,012
Go home, son.

309
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:53,778
I remember you.

310
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:57,481
Where's your kitty cat?

311
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,517
Well, he prefers LA.

312
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,055
The sun, the women.

313
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,824
Mr. Gregory wants
to speak to you.

314
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:08,893
I see that.

315
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:11,793
Hmm.

316
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:12,696
Turn the fuck around!

317
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,032
Huh?

318
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,678
You really need to
get better help.

319
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,245
Where is she, Mr. Phillips?

320
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,548
I have no idea.

321
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:34,783
I want her back.
Now look,

322
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:38,654
I found her, I brought her home to
you, and you paid me for that.

323
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,890
Come on, she was only
home for a few hours,

324
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,192
she packed some things,
and she was off again.

325
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:46,094
- And that is not my problem!
- Oh, but it is.

326
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:49,198
You were seen at the airport with
her, putting her on a plane.

327
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,633
Now, I want you to go get
her and bring her home.

328
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:53,935
Even if I knew where she was,
and I don't,

329
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:57,105
do you think that I would bring her
to you knowing what you did to her?

330
00:23:57,107 --> 00:23:58,673
What did she say to you?

331
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:01,912
I mean, what? What?
That I abused her?

332
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,982
That she just needed
a safe place?

333
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:10,220
She just once wanted to sleep and
not have to leave the light on?

334
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:14,158
I thought you were smart.

335
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:18,894
You're a sucker.

336
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,831
Sucker for a pretty girl
and a sob story.

337
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,735
I'd look into that
if I were you.

338
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,839
Watch your back, Carson.

339
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,240
- Come on, get up!
<i>- He was right.</i>

340
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:36,177
<i>His daughter had spun quite a tale
to get me to help her get away.</i>

341
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,848
<i>And he was smart enough to know
that I was dumb enough</i>

342
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,316
<i>to give her the money.</i>

343
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:45,853
<i>Once again,
a beautiful woman with a sob story.</i>

344
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,788
<i>You figure I'd have
learned my lesson by now.</i>

345
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>Not a chance.</i>

346
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:54,130
Mr. Phillips.

347
00:24:55,164 --> 00:24:57,198
I got tired of waiting.

348
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,100
You never called.

349
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:01,071
You are not a gentleman.

350
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:06,040
- How's Barbara?
- Barbara is fine. She's resting.

351
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,441
It's a game day.

352
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,910
I got a little bit
carried away with my affairs,

353
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:11,778
and I'm sorry I did not call.
I forgot.

354
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,682
Well, I'm here now,
so you don't have to call.

355
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,283
She doesn't want to see anybody.

356
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:20,121
Now look, it'll only
take a minute, and...

357
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:22,423
her family is concerned.

358
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:26,994
I feel like we have had this
conversation already, Mr. Phillips.

359
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,163
We both know
what the family wants.

360
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:32,999
I'm sorry, as her doctor, I cannot
recommend that she sees a stranger.

361
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:39,273
And I'm even more sorry that you
came all this way for nothing.

362
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:43,379
You know, the whole time that I was
sitting here, that phone didn't ring once.

363
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,815
How do you stay in business?

364
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,318
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

365
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,220
<i>Today's lunch will feature
meat loaf and gravy.</i>

366
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:57,457
<i>Today's lunch will feature
meat loaf and gravy.</i>

367
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,262
You just hold me. You'll be fine.

368
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,387
We have some new clients.

369
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:29,122
- Can you handle it?
- I don't have...

370
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:31,124
The kid wants more.
What should we do?

371
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,393
You need to step up and take care
of that little problem of ours.

372
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:36,361
- Go, go, go.
- Okay. <i>Adios.</i>

373
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,899
I'll take care of it.

374
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,466
<i>I found her file.
It was empty.</i>

375
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:51,203
<i>No progress reports.
No med list.</i>

376
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:55,339
<i>Just my client's address
and a few paid statements.</i>

377
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,510
<i>Most of his patients
had passed on.</i>

378
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:03,517
<i>It seemed like the good
doctor was also taking bets.</i>

379
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,417
<i>Interestingly though,</i>

380
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,921
<i>all the bets were
for us to lose.</i>

381
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,277
You can sit down
right here.

382
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,479
Such a pretty day.
You can listen to the game outside.

383
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,314
<i>It's ball
day here in sunny Galveston,</i>

384
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,551
<i>where Happy Chandler hopes to
lead his team to a victory...</i>

385
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:16,953
We're gonna go inside. You let us
know if you need anything, all right?

386
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,392
<i>Happy leads the Conference
in TD passes and his electrifying...</i>

387
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,630
Did you come from...

388
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:01,999
up there?

389
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,135
Yes, I did.

390
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,537
Oh, goodness.

391
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,306
Here, let me help you.

392
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:12,041
All right. Thank you.

393
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,212
Oh!
Are you okay?

394
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:19,214
Yeah.
A bit wobbly.

395
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:22,350
You wouldn't know a Barbara Van
Poole, would you?

396
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:25,421
Yes. But I've not seen
her for a long time.

397
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,056
Any idea where
she might be?

398
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,526
No. People just disappear here.

399
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,694
This is a bad place.

400
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,630
<i>As we approach
halftime, New Mexico still leads</i>

401
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:38,534
<i>even after that beautiful TD
pass from Happy Chandler...</i>

402
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,584
What is all the racket out here...
Oh!

403
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,585
Hi, Mr. Phillips.

404
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:59,287
I'm sorry.
Would you...

405
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,557
Would you mind getting
me this film developed?

406
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,593
Oh, sure.

407
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,427
What the hell
happened to you?

408
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:06,727
I fell.

409
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:08,329
That's fresh dirt.

410
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,165
I can get that cleaned up
for you, if you want.

411
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,368
All right.
That'd be nice.

412
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,336
Here. Thank you.
I appreciate it much.

413
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:16,637
Sure.
How's the game going?

414
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:18,506
Happy's messing it all up.

415
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:21,478
We're behind by a touchdown,
but we're favored by 11.

416
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,413
Well, it's still early.

417
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,315
<i>Except for
that one breathtaking run,</i>

418
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:30,116
<i>a terrible game so far
for Happy Chandler.</i>

419
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:31,686
<i>Abysmal passing by Chandler.</i>

420
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:34,054
- <i>Five interceptions.</i>
- They're gone, Mr. Phillips.

421
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,524
<i>Five of 18 on the day...</i>

422
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,161
They said they'd be back.

423
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:39,794
Who?

424
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:42,499
Four guys in a black Dodge,
California plates.

425
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:44,633
They friends of yours?

426
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:48,404
Well, not exactly.

427
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:53,273
Would you mind keeping
an eye on them for me?

428
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:57,613
They gave me a
hundred to keep an eye on you!

429
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,084
No. No need.
I took their money, but...

430
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,351
I don't see so good.

431
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:07,187
<i>Third interception
today for Happy Chandler.</i>

432
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:11,323
<i>Oh, no. Happy is still down.
He does not seem to be moving.</i>

433
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:15,362
<i>The trainer is on the field,
and he's waving for the stretcher.</i>

434
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:19,866
<i>This does not look good.
Chandler being carted off the field.</i>

435
00:32:19,868 --> 00:32:23,739
<i>The crowd has gone completely quiet.
They are stunned.</i>

436
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:39,721
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Coming through.

437
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,122
Stay back. Stay back.
That's my husband.

438
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:45,591
- Stay back.
- That's my husband!

439
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,228
That's my husband!

440
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,715
Please stand aside.

441
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,657
<i>I didn't know what to say.</i>

442
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,293
<i>After all these years,
it had to be perfect.</i>

443
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:23,862
<i>And let's face it,</i>

444
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:27,234
<i>the situation wasn't exactly
conducive to small talk.</i>

445
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,370
<i>I thought about Jayne.</i>

446
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:36,611
<i>I thought about Happy lying on a
slab instead of next to his wife.</i>

447
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,613
<i>I thought about the missing
Barbara Van Poole</i>

448
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:42,549
<i>and the mysterious doctor.</i>

449
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,419
<i>Most importantly,
I thought about having a drink...</i>

450
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,721
<i>and not a small one.</i>

451
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,569
- Yeah.
<i>- Carson?</i>

452
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:03,303
<i>It's Jayne.</i>

453
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:07,807
<i>Can you come up to the house?
I'd like to talk.</i>

454
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:30,495
<i>Before yesterday,
I hadn't seen her in 20 years.</i>

455
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:33,599
<i>I had pretty much convinced
myself that I was over her.</i>

456
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,603
<i>But that's not the first time
I've been wrong.</i>

457
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:39,372
How you doing, sir?
Come inside.

458
00:34:41,273 --> 00:34:43,642
How are you?
I'm doing good. Follow me.

459
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,778
Come sit right here.

460
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,881
Thank you.
No problem.

461
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:52,351
She'll be right with you shortly.
All right.

462
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,644
Hello, Carson.

463
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:21,680
Hello, Jayne.

464
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:25,851
Would you like a drink?

465
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,987
Well, it's 10:30 in the morning.

466
00:35:29,988 --> 00:35:31,255
The usual?

467
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:33,959
You did well.

468
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:36,695
Not really.

469
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:40,966
Well, it looks like you
got everything you need.

470
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,605
Looks can be deceiving, Carson.

471
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,580
So, what happened
with Charlie?

472
00:35:56,914 --> 00:35:57,949
He died.

473
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,951
Had a heart attack right
there in the garden.

474
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,487
I'm sorry.

475
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:06,491
There's no free lunches.

476
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:09,326
He wanted it all.
Turns out...

477
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:13,696
having everything was a
little too much for him.

478
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:15,933
You mind my asking
what he did for work?

479
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,735
He was in oil.

480
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,005
Oh, that's simple.

481
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,007
It wasn't.

482
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:24,809
And it isn't.

483
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:29,714
Like everything too good to be
true, it comes at a price.

484
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,421
Enough about me.
How about you? You doing well?

485
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:42,524
Well, I get by.

486
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:43,827
Well, we have that in common.

487
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,500
I...

488
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:52,734
I'd like to hire you.

489
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:55,438
I mean, that's what you do now, right?
You're a private investigator?

490
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,908
Yeah, that's what I do.

491
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:03,778
I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

492
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,783
It's still a small town and people
have nothing to do but talk.

493
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,817
Talk about what?

494
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:11,719
Oh, come on. How many
22-year-old athletes

495
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,621
do you see convulsing
on the football field?

496
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,992
Well, he got
hit pretty hard.

497
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,960
And that happens.

498
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:21,765
Yeah, well,
I've already heard rumors.

499
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,502
They don't think
this was football related.

500
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,636
Sheriff Walsh
is an idiot.

501
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:30,774
He'll want a quick
and clean answer.

502
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:36,911
We both know his...
stupidity is limitless.

503
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:39,049
Well, how'd he get to be
sheriff, anyway?

504
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,052
That very reason.

505
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,693
It's a bad place, Carson.

506
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,696
Far worse than you can imagine.

507
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,901
Doc owns everything
and everybody.

508
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:04,940
For years,
I hated you for leaving.

509
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:09,612
Over time, I came
to understand that...

510
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:13,482
escaping this place was the
smartest thing you could do.

511
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:30,998
Happy was running around
town with that slut, Rose.

512
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,765
My daughter's a scorned wife.

513
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,567
This is the first place
they'll come looking.

514
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:36,204
All right.

515
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:39,074
Why don't we just slow down,
just take one step at a time?

516
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:47,780
Becky hasn't had it easy
these past few years.

517
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:48,916
All right.

518
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,686
After Charlie died,
I...

519
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:55,657
I admitted myself to
Pleasant Meadows for a while.

520
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:59,060
I've been there, Jayne.
That ain't your style.

521
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:01,694
You're as tough as nails.

522
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,731
Those nails got rusty,
Carson.

523
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,067
Maybe you can help me
with something.

524
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,569
About the woman in the sanitarium?
Barbara Van Poole?

525
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:14,907
I told you. There's no
secrets in this town.

526
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:16,709
Did you ever meet her
when you were there?

527
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:17,645
Sure, I did.

528
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:19,914
That was a while ago.

529
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:24,119
Why is it that I'm having such a
hard time getting ahold of her?

530
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,253
I don't know.

531
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,823
When I left, I put all my
energy into raising Becky.

532
00:39:29,757 --> 00:39:32,193
Goddamn it, she had to fall in
love with a football player!

533
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,662
That sound familiar?

534
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,937
We were too young, Carson.

535
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,940
Just like them.

536
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:02,656
Emile will take care of your first
payment, and he will see you out.

537
00:40:05,058 --> 00:40:06,126
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:10,696
Oh... shit.

539
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:18,837
<i>I reached out to my
client in LA to give her an update,</i>

540
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,174
<i>but oddly, her number
had been disconnected.</i>

541
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,807
<i>I couldn't say no to Jayne,</i>

542
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,847
<i>so I decided my first questions
would be for the coroner,</i>

543
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,984
<i>who for some reason chose not
to return any of my calls.</i>

544
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:33,118
Hot dog, buddy.

545
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,021
I have been looking for you
all morning.

546
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:38,089
And who are you?
I'm Carson Phillips.

547
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:41,860
- Oh, yeah. I've been rather busy.
- I can see that.

548
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,827
My treat.
You don't have to do that.

549
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,931
I need some information
about Happy Chandler.

550
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:49,034
He's dead.

551
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:50,937
I need a little more
information than that.

552
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:53,639
It's not about the money.

553
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:55,608
Now, will you please stop?

554
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:04,217
- He took a big shot.
- But was it the hit that killed him?

555
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:06,252
The hit was vicious.

556
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:11,123
It broke his collar bone,
fractured his femur...

557
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,860
But?
But...

558
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:20,730
we found extremely
high levels of ephedrine

559
00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:24,968
and some yet to be determined
chemical substance in his blood.

560
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,004
Now what exactly
does that mean?

561
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:31,108
Well, some of these athletes
use it as a stimulant.

562
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,879
But we've sent it to the lab
in Dallas for a full analysis.

563
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:38,784
Should have the results
back in a few days.

564
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:42,154
Can I count on you when
that does come through?

565
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:44,190
Absolutely.

566
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,321
Jaynie.
Doc.

567
00:42:20,724 --> 00:42:23,895
You get on wonderful.
Well, thank you. So do you.

568
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:27,997
How about a nice glass of
rosé from my private stock?

569
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:31,367
Sounds great.
Your place is so lovely, as always.

570
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,373
Not bad for a poor
kid from West Texas, huh?

571
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:03,033
You're here about your
daughter, aren't you?

572
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,137
And you think
I can help.

573
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:12,974
Doc, you and I both know she had
nothing to do with Happy's death.

574
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:14,809
Happy's murder.

575
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:16,311
Fine, murder.

576
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:18,480
It's bad enough
she's a widow at this age.

577
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:20,350
Now she's
the number one suspect?

578
00:43:21,984 --> 00:43:24,322
You have to admit,
it doesn't look good.

579
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:29,393
You could call off Sheriff
Walsh if you wanted to.

580
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:35,062
You flatter me if you think
I have that kind of influence.

581
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:36,934
Oh, please, Doc.

582
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:39,769
You could affect the tides
if you wanted to.

583
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,173
All right.

584
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,143
Let's say
I do call Walsh...

585
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:50,846
get him to do
what you want.

586
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:53,149
What do I get?

587
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,184
What do you have in mind?

588
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:59,121
Well, you mentioned
the tides.

589
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,457
I'm interested
in what's offshore.

590
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:03,926
I bet you are.

591
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:08,998
Who do you think kept the
State off your late husband?

592
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,337
All those toxicity reports.

593
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,274
He paid for some of this.

594
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,010
So you see...

595
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:24,381
I've been helping you all along.

596
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:26,215
How much?

597
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:28,317
I'll be your partner.

598
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:30,987
Forty-nine percent.

599
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:32,988
For you, of course.

600
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:39,061
My attorney will be in touch.

601
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:42,431
Good.

602
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,101
Oh, and one other thing.

603
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:48,437
Your...

604
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:52,375
old paramour, Carson...

605
00:44:55,143 --> 00:44:56,478
I know you hired him.

606
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,149
But you have to
call him off now.

607
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:03,519
Get him to stop snooping around.

608
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,356
He could undo a lot of
business just by making noise.

609
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:11,126
And what are
you suggesting?

610
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,193
Well...

611
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:17,397
you can convince him
in ways that I can't.

612
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,136
Now who's flattering who?

613
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:23,972
I'll do my best.

614
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:26,841
If you don't...

615
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,978
I'll have to talk to him.

616
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,421
Hey, Slide, how you doing?

617
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:43,021
Umm, honestly,
not too good.

618
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,956
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah. Bourbon.

619
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,260
Neat or on the rocks?
Neat.

620
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,996
Why is that?

621
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,096
Why?

622
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,130
This thing with Happy, man.

623
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:55,601
- It's heavy. It's really heavy.
- Oh, is that so?

624
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:56,570
Far out.

625
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,073
You know everything that's
happening around here.

626
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:01,407
Did Happy do drugs?

627
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:04,109
Happy's drug was Rose.

628
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,012
Couldn't get enough
of that sweet ass.

629
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,447
Did Becky know about Rose?

630
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:10,184
Hell, yeah.
We all knew.

631
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,954
How'd you do
on the game?

632
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,326
I bet a little and I lose a little.
You know?

633
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:21,360
How'd Mitchell do?

634
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,395
Oh, shit. Mitchell?

635
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:25,899
He owes Doc
a shitload of money.

636
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:30,068
Oh? Got so bad,
he had to let Lorenzo go.

637
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,105
Oh. How'd Lorenzo do?

638
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:36,041
He lost his ass.

639
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,578
You know, for a guy
who used to change bedpans,

640
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,448
he's got some
pretty nice threads.

641
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:45,584
You know what, I think
he's dealing some dope.

642
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:49,187
No harm in dealing
a little dope, is there?

643
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:51,590
Now, would Happy
go to him to get drugs?

644
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:53,460
Lorenzo? Uhh...

645
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:56,193
Nah, he would
go to Mitchell.

646
00:46:56,195 --> 00:46:58,331
After all, he's a doctor,
isn't he?

647
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:04,203
Now, why are you asking me
all these questions?

648
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:07,240
Hell, you know me.
I'm just curious.

649
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:15,312
<i>I didn't like the
look of the guy at the bar,</i>

650
00:47:15,314 --> 00:47:18,584
<i>so I decided to wait outside
to see if he followed me.</i>

651
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,622
<i>Instead, I saw Lorenzo.</i>

662
00:47:59,391 --> 00:48:01,294
<i>I went by the coroner's office.</i>

663
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,527
<i>Skipping the science lesson,</i>

664
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:07,365
<i>he said that it was tainted
speed that had killed Happy.</i>

665
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,101
Thought you said
you were just passing through.

666
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:15,273
Well, that's changed.

667
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:18,143
Have you been hired
by Jayne Hunt?

668
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:20,810
Hired to do what?

669
00:48:20,812 --> 00:48:23,312
Oh, come on. Protect Becky.

670
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:26,382
Happy's been blatantly
cheating on her all over town.

671
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:28,384
It seems like
it's open-shut to me.

672
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:31,688
How do you know it's not one of
those endless Texas bluebonnets

673
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,523
that he was deflowering,

674
00:48:33,525 --> 00:48:35,994
promising he would leave his
wife for them and didn't?

675
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:37,496
I don't buy it.

676
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,829
Or maybe more likely,

677
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:42,432
it's a bunch of people getting rich
off of him messing up on the field.

678
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:44,266
What are you getting at?

679
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:48,238
Maybe they made him the same
deal they made me years ago.

680
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,742
But they didn't want him dead,
they just wanted him to mess up.

681
00:48:52,577 --> 00:48:54,744
You know what I think?

682
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:58,282
I think all that LA sunshine
has done made you a bit loopy.

683
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:01,518
I think
it's cleared my head up.

684
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:16,767
Light me.

685
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:29,380
Wanna do a shot?

686
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,048
All right.

687
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:34,350
Two.

688
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:42,258
To Happy.

689
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:45,428
He really was a great guy.

690
00:49:53,336 --> 00:49:56,239
Is that your
mourning dress?

691
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,277
It's black, isn't it?

692
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:02,646
What there is of it.

693
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:09,352
Did you get jealous every time
he went home with his wife?

694
00:50:10,453 --> 00:50:12,188
You wanna know
if I killed him?

695
00:50:14,257 --> 00:50:15,425
I'd like to know that.

696
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:21,598
Did Happy do drugs?

697
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:24,802
Please, no more questions.

698
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:28,803
You were a football player.
I like football players.

699
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:30,740
But not so much
when they talk.

700
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,251
You like to watch?
Huh?

701
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,355
Do you like to watch?
Excuse me?

702
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:48,725
People.
People.

703
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:52,695
Yeah, I guess I do.
Kind of a habit.

704
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:55,832
Those boys...

705
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,435
Always whispering.

706
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:04,339
Being secretive,
like we don't know what's really going on.

707
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:09,309
Well, I have noticed
that since I've been gone

708
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:12,780
things have gotten a
little bit more organized.

709
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:15,617
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's got the whole state wired.
- Rose.

710
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,356
I'd like to have a moment
with my friend here, angel.

711
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,395
Yes, Daddy.

712
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:40,575
Let's you and me take a ride.

713
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:43,477
All right.

714
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:55,322
Let's go.

715
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:21,414
Are we going anywhere
in particular?

716
00:52:25,386 --> 00:52:27,822
<i>You're here looking
for that Van Poole woman.</i>

717
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,389
Yup, that's right.

718
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:33,526
I
can tell you where she is.

719
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:36,597
Well, that would be nice.

720
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:39,767
But if I do that...

721
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:42,903
I want you
to go home.

722
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:47,808
I'll give you a healthy
going away present.

723
00:52:50,444 --> 00:52:52,412
Carson,
you're a smart guy.

724
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:57,415
I'm sure you've put most of
the pieces together already.

725
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:00,654
I just can't have anybody
poking around in my business.

726
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:03,088
Honestly, Doc,

727
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,391
I ain't interested
in your business.

728
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:12,867
I know Jayne Hunt hired you
to keep her daughter safe.

729
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,807
And I know you've been sniffing
around Pleasant Meadows.

730
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,711
That's just not gonna
work out for you.

731
00:53:26,113 --> 00:53:27,347
Then, all right.

732
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:30,450
Where is Barbara Van Poole?

733
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,019
She's dead.

734
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:37,557
She's as dead
as Julius Caesar.

735
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,561
And I'm sure
she's not the only one.

736
00:53:42,962 --> 00:53:46,732
Rich but crazy family members that
nobody ever gave a fuck about.

737
00:53:48,968 --> 00:53:50,802
Look,

738
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:54,805
you go back to Los Angeles with
a police report from Walsh.

739
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:58,742
I'll have the coroner give you
a legitimate death certificate

740
00:53:58,744 --> 00:54:01,047
and a nice will for her kin.

741
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:05,651
It's not a bad deal, Carson.

742
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:07,886
Walk away.

743
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,828
Oh, man.

744
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:19,898
I can't.

745
00:54:20,899 --> 00:54:24,001
I screwed Jayne over
once before,

746
00:54:24,003 --> 00:54:26,772
and I just can't live with
myself if I do it again.

747
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,750
Suit yourself.

748
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:52,865
Go on. Get him outta here.

749
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,815
<i>Doc's goon dropped me
off in a deserted part of town,</i>

750
00:55:11,817 --> 00:55:13,850
<i>just to aggravate me.</i>

751
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,052
<i>But I guess it was better than being
dropped off the side of a bridge.</i>

752
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:37,041
Get him. Get him.

753
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,776
Stop!

754
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:16,678
- Make a choice. Make a choice.
- No, no, no.

755
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,883
You know what?
I don't even like them sons of bitches.

756
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:03,093
All right, what's so important that
you wouldn't talk on the phone?

757
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:05,661
Carson's in trouble.

758
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:07,930
So?

759
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:11,598
Some hit men followed
him out from LA.

760
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,236
The morgue's filling up.
He killed two of them.

761
00:57:14,837 --> 00:57:15,838
Really?

762
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:21,910
Isn't that interesting?

763
00:57:23,812 --> 00:57:25,215
What you want me
to do about it?

764
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:28,150
Make this
his last warning.

765
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:32,787
And with Jaynie?

766
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:35,258
Keep squeezing.

767
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:37,860
Better for all of us.

768
00:57:40,963 --> 00:57:43,831
- I want every drop of that oil.
- All right.

769
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:00,249
"Arrest imminent!"

770
00:58:01,984 --> 00:58:05,951
You know, we ID'd those shooters.
They're from LA.

771
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:07,855
But I think you
already knew that.

772
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:09,857
They're hit men.

773
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:11,894
Wanna tell me who they are?

774
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:15,164
They're hit men.

775
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:19,765
Don't get cute
with me, Carson.

776
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,300
I'll throw you in the hole
with them sodomites.

777
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,036
They'll have a good
ol' time with you, too.

778
00:58:23,038 --> 00:58:25,307
Mmm. Well, I can
take care of myself.

779
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,077
How much money you owe them?

780
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:31,743
Fifty thousand.

781
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:32,879
Fifty thousand?

782
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,014
On gambling?

783
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:37,016
What difference
does it make?

784
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,752
Now look, Walsh.
I'll make you a deal.

785
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:42,054
You lay off Becky,
and I'll leave town.

786
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:43,955
You'll never hear
from me again.

787
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,024
I don't think you're in
no position to make a deal.

788
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,362
Oh, yes, I am.
With what I know.

789
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,164
Lay off Becky.

790
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:52,730
Can't do that, Carson.

791
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:55,066
Thanks to you,
everybody's watching now.

792
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:57,869
Oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

793
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:01,042
That don't concern you.
Oh, it does concern me.

794
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:04,911
Let me ask you something.

795
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:12,784
You think helping Jayne is somehow gonna
wipe away all your sins from the past?

796
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,822
The way you just got up outta
here and left that girl behind?

797
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:22,295
My leaving Jayne here was the best
thing I could've possibly done for her.

798
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,932
You do know it's gonna be
easy to get a conviction.

799
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:29,934
Jayne is not
very well liked around here.

800
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:32,337
Now, why would Jayne not be
very well liked around here?

801
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,239
What did she ever
do to anybody?

802
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:37,809
Her husband Charlie's oil
poisoned the place.

803
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,011
Done everything we could do
to keep it a secret.

804
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:41,814
This is a beach town, remember?

805
00:59:49,322 --> 00:59:50,357
Recognize her?

806
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,093
That's Becky.

807
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:58,729
And you should know
that she told me

808
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:02,100
that Happy beat the hell out of
her on more than one occasion.

809
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,003
One time,
he damn near killed her.

810
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:07,171
And why didn't you
do anything about it?

811
01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:09,406
Like what?
Arrest our star quarterback?

812
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:18,849
I can make your little shoot-out last
night a clear case of self-defense

813
01:00:18,851 --> 01:00:22,221
or I can make sure
you rot in jail.

814
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:24,823
This is Texas, after all.

815
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:28,928
I'm gonna see my client.

816
01:00:29,995 --> 01:00:31,096
Your move.

817
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:51,116
Thank you. I know.

818
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:52,850
Hard.

819
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,230
Becky?

820
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:14,870
- Hi.
- I know that guy.

821
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:16,473
I seen him before.
What's his name?

822
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:19,909
That's Don.
He was one of Happy's best friends.

823
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:22,447
Right. That's where I saw him.
I saw him at the club.

824
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,316
So, how you doing?

825
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:29,919
Better.
Good, good.

826
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:32,288
Would you mind if I
asked you some questions?

827
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:35,124
Would you be all right with that?
Listen, I don't know anything.

828
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:37,795
Can I ask how things
were going before?

829
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,034
Look, Becky, I know about Rose
and maybe some others, so...

830
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,438
You know, unless you're able to tell
me, I can't help you.

831
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,275
- Sorry, it's just embarrassing.
- Yeah.

832
01:01:52,277 --> 01:01:55,178
He fooled around a lot before
we were engaged, but...

833
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,281
promised he wouldn't
do it anymore.

834
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:02,084
Well, you gotta
tell me something.

835
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:05,354
Was Happy doing drugs?
No. He was a workout nut.

836
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:09,257
Well, this is the problem, Becky.
We got this crazy sheriff, Walsh.

837
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:14,297
He thinks you're the only suspect
and that you have prime motive.

838
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:16,066
I didn't kill
my husband.

839
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,305
You okay, honey?

840
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,441
I seen them pictures
Walsh showed me.

841
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:29,077
You never told me that
he was hurting her.

842
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,545
That's motive, Jayne.

843
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,314
Come on.

844
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:35,050
If you want me to help you,
you gotta tell me everything.

845
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:37,152
Isn't it clear to you that
she didn't do it, Carson?

846
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,987
That is not the point.

847
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,456
Look, everyone in this town
doesn't like you. Why?

848
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,058
Of course they don't.
I'm rich.

849
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,128
No, no. They said that your
husband poisoned everybody

850
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,297
or whatever the hell
that means.

851
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,899
Look, you gotta
come straight with me

852
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,036
and she's gotta get
straight with me.

853
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,278
Let me show you something.

854
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,553
From what I understand,

855
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,954
Charlie paid off every
inspector in the State of Texas

856
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,324
to get this place
up and running.

857
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,295
Within a year,
people started getting sick.

858
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,528
They tested the groundwater.

859
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,233
The reports were inconclusive.

860
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,470
I don't really believe that.

861
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:31,340
Just more corruption,
like everything else in this town.

862
01:03:33,141 --> 01:03:35,044
People die and nobody cares.

863
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,412
I...

864
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,348
I found all this out
after Charlie died.

865
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,183
Well, that's not
your responsibility.

866
01:03:44,185 --> 01:03:45,220
Well...

867
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:48,489
it is.
Why?

868
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,325
I...

869
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,229
I wanted life to be easy
for our daughter.

870
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:58,364
Our daughter.

871
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,169
Carson, she's our daughter.

872
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:04,205
The hell you
talking about?

873
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,643
When I came to visit you
before I married Charlie.

874
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:12,111
Why wouldn't you tell me
something like that?

875
01:04:12,113 --> 01:04:14,548
Well, you sure as hell weren't
ready for marriage and a baby!

876
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,518
Don't I have something
to do with that decision?

877
01:04:17,485 --> 01:04:18,520
Come on!

878
01:04:20,221 --> 01:04:22,122
Why'd you leave me
in the first place?

879
01:04:24,192 --> 01:04:26,528
You said you'd take me with you.
Why didn't you?

880
01:04:30,265 --> 01:04:31,366
I'm sorry.

881
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:35,303
I'm so sorry.

882
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:46,380
I never stopped loving you.
Are you sure?

883
01:04:58,125 --> 01:04:59,694
<i>So it turns
out I had a daughter.</i>

884
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,663
<i>This trip is full of surprises.</i>

885
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:08,101
<i>And I have to admit that I was overcome
with the strangest of instincts.</i>

886
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:10,402
<i>Strange for me, anyway.</i>

887
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:14,141
<i>I actually started to think
of others instead of myself.</i>

888
01:05:15,509 --> 01:05:17,377
<i>I couldn't imagine
what would come next.</i>

889
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:23,351
- Hello.
<i>- Mr. Phillips.</i>

890
01:05:23,551 --> 01:05:25,150
Yup.

891
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:27,219
It's Michael Townsend,
the coroner.

892
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:31,556
You asked me to call you when the
medical report came in on Mr. Chandler.

893
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:32,759
Yeah, go ahead.

894
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:37,364
It was a high concentration
of amphetamines and steroids.

895
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:41,766
<i>There was also a finding
of doxorubicin in his system.</i>

896
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:43,737
What the hell is that?
<i>Well...</i>

897
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:47,138
that's the odd part.
It's a cancer drug.

898
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,542
Cancer drug?

899
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,444
Well, you can't buy that
over the counter.

900
01:05:52,446 --> 01:05:55,616
Oh, no. It has to be
prescribed by a physician.

901
01:05:57,683 --> 01:05:59,152
All right. Thank you.

902
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:32,752
Hey, you!

903
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:35,221
What you got there?

904
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:37,454
Coffee?
Coffee.

905
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:40,393
Well, I'm gonna have to put
a bit of bourbon in that.

906
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:44,429
Come on. Now I'm impressed.

907
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:47,700
Come on in.

908
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:52,738
She told you.

909
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:55,773
I'm not dumb.

910
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:58,511
You could tell a lot just by
the way she looked at you.

911
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:01,814
She never had that look
in her eye with Charlie.

912
01:07:03,749 --> 01:07:05,716
I asked her what was
really going on.

913
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:08,453
She said you were
the love of her life.

914
01:07:09,688 --> 01:07:11,822
When Charlie proposed...

915
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:15,327
she went out to visit you in
Los Angeles just to make sure.

916
01:07:17,362 --> 01:07:18,763
She made the right choice.

917
01:07:19,564 --> 01:07:21,766
I'm scared.
Don't be.

918
01:07:22,735 --> 01:07:24,536
Ain't nothing gonna
happen to you.

919
01:07:25,537 --> 01:07:26,638
You understand?

920
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:31,443
Come on in.

921
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:41,451
Well, what do you think?
You think I need coffee or bourbon?

922
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:42,487
Coffee.

923
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,422
Coffee? All right,
have a seat.

924
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,658
Have a seat.
Sorry about the mess.

925
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,863
I'm just not very good
at taking care of myself.

926
01:07:52,797 --> 01:07:54,731
You sure are.

927
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:57,733
You're one...
one beautiful girl.

928
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:59,836
All right now,
what do we got here?

929
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:02,474
- You got a coffee, regular, for you.
- Yes.

930
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:04,841
And for me.

931
01:08:04,843 --> 01:08:07,776
And what did you buy here?
Doughnuts.

932
01:08:07,778 --> 01:08:09,580
Oh! I like these.

933
01:08:10,314 --> 01:08:11,316
Here you go.

934
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,583
- One for you.
- Thank you.

935
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:14,753
And one for me.

936
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:18,754
Would you like me to teach you
how they eat doughnuts in LA?

937
01:08:18,756 --> 01:08:20,856
Yeah.
I can't.

938
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:23,762
'Cause they don't eat doughnuts in LA.
They eat sprouts.

939
01:08:24,696 --> 01:08:29,299
However, I can show you
how they do it in Texas.

940
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:30,768
You ready?

941
01:08:32,436 --> 01:08:33,537
Dunk.

942
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:39,943
Maybe smaller bites.

943
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:42,245
Yeah.

944
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:45,646
You're too pretty
to be dunkin' doughnuts.

945
01:08:45,648 --> 01:08:47,749
Cheers.

946
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:49,820
First time I've ever toasted
without liquor in it.

947
01:08:59,663 --> 01:09:00,798
What the hell?

948
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:03,934
It's Slide.

949
01:09:06,536 --> 01:09:07,837
Becky, close the door.

950
01:09:10,507 --> 01:09:12,641
The hell happened to you?

951
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,978
I went over to see Lorenzo.

952
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:17,878
To do what?
To collect some money?

953
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,683
You lied to me, Slide.
Becky, get some towels.

954
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:23,754
Why? Why this game?

955
01:09:24,554 --> 01:09:25,789
A hunch?

956
01:09:26,522 --> 01:09:28,656
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.

957
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:31,959
What the hell was that for?

958
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:34,763
Because that girl in there
has a lot to lose

959
01:09:34,765 --> 01:09:36,499
if I don't get to
the bottom of it.

960
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,501
- I did bring your replacement pills.
- Oh, thank you.

961
01:09:40,503 --> 01:09:42,839
I'll try not to drop them
down the toilet this time.

962
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:45,674
Oh, damn it.

963
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,943
You ain't that tough, Slide.

964
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:51,645
- Now just tell me the truth. Just do it.
- Okay. Okay.

965
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:52,915
Jaynie?

966
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:03,423
I overheard this conversation
between Doc and Happy.

967
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:06,093
Happy owed Doc
a shitload of money.

968
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:09,564
- I'll see you later in my office.
- See you around, Carson.

969
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,600
Then Doc told him,

970
01:10:12,602 --> 01:10:16,036
"The only way you're gonna get even
with me is if you throw the game."

971
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:19,773
Starting a fistfight on the night before
a big game. Have you lost your mind?

972
01:10:19,775 --> 01:10:21,009
<i>Go home to your wife.</i>

973
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:23,478
That's the truth.

974
01:10:24,046 --> 01:10:25,779
That's what I thought.

975
01:10:25,781 --> 01:10:27,680
- Then Happy got greedy.
- Very greedy.

976
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,517
The kid wants more.
What should we do?

977
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:32,786
You need to step up and take
care of that little problem of ours.

978
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:34,621
Go, go, go.

979
01:10:34,623 --> 01:10:36,691
Mitchell made all the bets
so it wouldn't look suspicious.

980
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:38,693
And then he killed him.

981
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:41,797
I knew it.

982
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:43,832
Jaynie?

983
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,933
What the hell
are you doing here?

984
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:47,969
Sorry to interrupt.

985
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:51,473
- Becky around?
- No.

986
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,507
Well, we need
to talk to her.

987
01:10:53,975 --> 01:10:55,909
Oh, God. Shit. I knew it!

988
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:57,778
You gonna help me, though,
aren't ya?

989
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,659
- Yeah.
<i>- Carson.</i>

990
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:15,496
Walsh is here with
an arrest warrant for Becky.

991
01:11:18,499 --> 01:11:19,533
Put him on.

992
01:11:23,604 --> 01:11:24,904
Carson, where is she?

993
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,738
<i>Now listen to me,
Walsh.</i>

994
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,741
You trusted me one time,
and I need you to trust me again.

995
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,512
I know for a fact that
that game was fixed.

996
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:35,881
A lot of people could've
benefited from it.

997
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:37,482
And I know who they are.

998
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:39,952
She was seen stalking him
outside of Rose's.

999
01:11:39,954 --> 01:11:42,120
<i>The game was fixed!</i>

1000
01:11:42,122 --> 01:11:45,692
Give me 24 hours,
and I will find your killer.

1001
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:49,830
You better be right.

1002
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,566
Else it'll be your tit in
the ringer along with hers.

1003
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:56,801
I owe you, Walsh.

1004
01:11:56,803 --> 01:11:59,506
And watch your mouth.
That's my daughter you're talking about.

1005
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:10,816
Carson, he's gone.

1006
01:12:10,818 --> 01:12:12,585
I heard you went to see Doc.

1007
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:14,485
<i>We made a deal.</i>

1008
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,723
He promised to keep
Walsh off Becky's back.

1009
01:12:19,192 --> 01:12:21,060
<i>I knew I couldn't trust
anyone but you, Carson.</i>

1010
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:23,696
Thank you.

1011
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:36,809
To what do I owe
this surprise?

1012
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,016
I know about the fix.

1013
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:46,851
Now, relax.

1014
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:49,220
It's a perfect reason
to keep Happy alive.

1015
01:12:49,222 --> 01:12:51,624
Kind of guaranteed
your arrangement.

1016
01:12:54,826 --> 01:12:56,526
Makes sense.

1017
01:12:56,528 --> 01:13:00,033
Now, unfortunately for you,
Happy got greedy.

1018
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:01,999
He got a partner.

1019
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:04,734
Now, I know Mitchell
was making drugs

1020
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:06,937
and Lorenzo was selling them

1021
01:13:06,939 --> 01:13:09,873
and expanding and cutting
into your business.

1022
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:12,509
And maybe he paid
his debt off to you,

1023
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:14,180
and you lost your edge.

1024
01:13:14,813 --> 01:13:17,183
And maybe you
set them both up.

1025
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:20,717
Good theory.

1026
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,188
And you make a good point.

1027
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:26,023
I would be happier with
those two out of the way,

1028
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:28,024
but I'd rather
sit back and watch.

1029
01:13:28,026 --> 01:13:30,062
You break up the drug ring,

1030
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:32,862
Lorenzo disappears,

1031
01:13:32,864 --> 01:13:34,864
Mitchell can't pay me,

1032
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:38,168
and Pleasant Meadows
becomes the best resort

1033
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,106
and 18 holes
in all of South Texas.

1034
01:13:42,908 --> 01:13:44,176
You want a free membership?

1035
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:50,015
There's a man like me
in every town.

1036
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,053
We're all alike.

1037
01:13:57,621 --> 01:13:58,957
Some are just...

1038
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,126
better.

1039
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,265
I never lose, Carson.

1040
01:14:10,836 --> 01:14:12,004
I'll keep that in mind.

1041
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:22,798
Here you go.

1042
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:27,136
- Good job.
- My wife.

1043
01:16:28,203 --> 01:16:30,973
What were you doing,
rolling around in a grave?

1044
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:34,142
<i>Rolling around in a grave?</i>

1045
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:36,843
She's dead.
And she's not the only one.

1046
01:16:36,845 --> 01:16:39,045
That's fresh dirt.
I can get that cleaned up for you.

1047
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:42,084
People just disappear here.
This is a bad place.

1048
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:45,786
You all right, Mr. Phillips?

1049
01:17:04,206 --> 01:17:05,407
Found you.

1050
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:09,277
Good evening,
Mr. Carson Phillips.

1051
01:17:11,847 --> 01:17:12,981
Miles.

1052
01:17:13,315 --> 01:17:16,251
Why couldn't you
just get lost?

1053
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:19,086
You were warned
so many times.

1054
01:17:20,154 --> 01:17:21,222
Just let me guess.

1055
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:26,361
You was billing patients'
families after they was dead?

1056
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:28,794
That didn't make
you enough money,

1057
01:17:28,796 --> 01:17:31,096
so you started
a new business with Lorenzo.

1058
01:17:31,098 --> 01:17:33,098
Is that right?

1059
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,068
Mmm, that's about the slow
and skinny of it. Mm-hmm.

1060
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,170
Well, let me congratulate you.
Hmm.

1061
01:17:38,172 --> 01:17:40,139
'Cause you're on the way to
being the biggest meth dealer

1062
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,409
in the State of Texas.

1063
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:43,010
Thank you.

1064
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:45,246
It looks like you
saved me some work.

1065
01:17:46,415 --> 01:17:51,150
No, no, no, no.
This grave ain't big enough for me.

1066
01:17:51,152 --> 01:17:53,018
Why don't you give me
a helping hand?

1067
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,189
I can't get my hands any more dirty.
Put the shovel...

1068
01:18:04,232 --> 01:18:05,399
I kill you!

1069
01:18:25,486 --> 01:18:28,188
I got you, <i>cabrón!</i>

1070
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:57,984
You hear me?

1071
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:02,289
I'm coming!

1072
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,534
What the hell?

1073
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,393
I got you, motherfucker!

1074
01:20:02,514 --> 01:20:03,549
Fuck!

1075
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:11,390
Fuck.

1076
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:16,460
No, no, no, no!

1077
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:17,495
No!

1078
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:30,041
It's over, Miles.

1079
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:33,111
It's over.

1080
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,215
Put the gun down.

1081
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:40,583
Put it down.

1082
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,487
Go ahead. Put it down.

1083
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,292
Now, you be a gentleman.

1084
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,495
Be a gentleman...

1085
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:53,231
and just tell me...

1086
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:57,334
you poisoned Happy
with them bad drugs.

1087
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:06,475
And that you murdered him.

1088
01:21:06,477 --> 01:21:07,645
You tell me that.

1089
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:10,281
Say it.

1090
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:17,655
Sorry.

1091
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:25,530
I always knew that you
were one of the greats.

1092
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:36,572
Yeah,
he got what he deserved!

1093
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:23,320
You wouldn't happen to have a
light, would you?

1094
01:22:24,454 --> 01:22:25,522
What happened here?

1095
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:31,158
Well, let's see.

1096
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,496
You got Mitchell's meth
lab that just blew up,

1097
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:40,636
and you got a whole bunch of his
patients buried all over these grounds.

1098
01:22:42,103 --> 01:22:43,372
Well, I ain't surprised.

1099
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:47,711
What was
I supposed to do?

1100
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:49,776
Well, I don't know.

1101
01:22:49,778 --> 01:22:53,413
What were you supposed
to do, <i>Sheriff?</i>

1102
01:22:53,415 --> 01:22:55,716
That ain't the way
things run around here.

1103
01:22:55,718 --> 01:22:57,185
You should know better.

1104
01:22:58,521 --> 01:22:59,688
Where's Miles at?

1105
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,258
Miles is dead.

1106
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:09,428
And he told me that he was the
one who gave Happy them bad drugs

1107
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:13,469
just to cover his bets or
guarantee they would happen.

1108
01:23:15,236 --> 01:23:17,738
I told you Becky never had
anything to do with this.

1109
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,173
I told you that.

1110
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:27,415
Fraud. Drug smuggling. Murder.

1111
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:31,519
You got some case
on your hands, buddy.

1112
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:34,855
Some case.

1113
01:23:34,857 --> 01:23:37,356
I wouldn't be surprised if
you were reelected next year.

1114
01:23:38,626 --> 01:23:40,361
I like the sound of that.

1115
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:42,397
Any holes?

1116
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:46,401
Just the ones you're gonna
be digging up tonight.

1117
01:23:48,703 --> 01:23:50,405
You gonna lay off Becky?

1118
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,274
Well...

1119
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:57,612
everyone's dead.

1120
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:11,359
You look like shit.

1121
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:14,361
Want a drink?

1122
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:19,633
It's 1:00 a.m.
Do you ever sleep?

1123
01:24:20,267 --> 01:24:21,469
I try not to.

1124
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:24,806
I hate those little
snippets of death.

1125
01:24:26,774 --> 01:24:30,510
So, I understand
you had quite a night.

1126
01:24:31,411 --> 01:24:33,446
Oh. You already heard.

1127
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:34,482
So...

1128
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:37,852
my competition is
no longer with us.

1129
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:40,387
Now...

1130
01:24:41,355 --> 01:24:43,457
I guess I owe you one,
Carson.

1131
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:46,224
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

1132
01:24:46,226 --> 01:24:49,527
And I understand that you
made a deal with Jayne.

1133
01:24:49,529 --> 01:24:51,596
I did.

1134
01:24:51,598 --> 01:24:54,266
I'm guessing it has something
to do with her oil wells.

1135
01:24:54,668 --> 01:24:56,533
Mm-hmm.

1136
01:24:56,535 --> 01:25:00,741
And I'm sure she asked you
to ask Walsh to back off.

1137
01:25:01,408 --> 01:25:02,509
She did.

1138
01:25:03,242 --> 01:25:04,478
And I asked him.

1139
01:25:05,478 --> 01:25:06,579
And he didn't.

1140
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:09,650
He didn't?

1141
01:25:11,418 --> 01:25:14,284
Is Becky in trouble?
Not anymore.

1142
01:25:14,286 --> 01:25:16,620
Miles killed Happy.

1143
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:25,866
Says you.

1144
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:28,434
There's no proof.

1145
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:30,770
Just you saying so.

1146
01:25:33,473 --> 01:25:36,741
You might wanna
let this one go, Carson.

1147
01:25:36,743 --> 01:25:39,712
Unless, of course,
you want this whole thing reopened.

1148
01:25:43,015 --> 01:25:48,387
The deal I made with Jayne
is between me and her.

1149
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:56,929
There's no end to the lengths a mother
will go to protect her daughter.

1150
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:01,600
When's enough enough?

1151
01:26:04,704 --> 01:26:06,404
There's always more.

1152
01:26:15,781 --> 01:26:16,916
Thanks for the drink.

1153
01:26:18,717 --> 01:26:19,951
I told you, Carson.

1154
01:26:21,387 --> 01:26:22,621
I never lose.

1155
01:26:24,824 --> 01:26:26,224
Yeah, you told me.

1156
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:01,426
It's all over.

1157
01:27:02,694 --> 01:27:04,528
I knew I could
count on you.

1158
01:27:59,117 --> 01:28:00,851
Good morning.
Morning.

1159
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,788
You looked so peaceful,
I didn't want to wake you.

1160
01:28:06,957 --> 01:28:07,957
How you doing?

1161
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,093
Wonderful. You?

1162
01:28:11,795 --> 01:28:12,830
Me, too.

1163
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:15,966
Want some breakfast?

1164
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,432
Thanks.

1165
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,469
What, for last night
or for breakfast?

1166
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:24,074
Well, I haven't had
breakfast yet.

1167
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:28,876
Get dressed.

1168
01:28:28,878 --> 01:28:30,580
Let's join our daughter.

1169
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:37,887
Some things never change.

1170
01:28:39,455 --> 01:28:42,792
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

1171
01:29:25,734 --> 01:29:28,803
Last night felt like
it was 20 years ago.

1172
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:32,641
When we were younger...

1173
01:29:34,476 --> 01:29:35,610
and healthier.

1174
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:39,147
How much time
do you have, Jayne?

1175
01:29:45,053 --> 01:29:46,088
Not much.

1176
01:29:47,889 --> 01:29:52,558
You told me you met Barbara
Van Poole at the sanitarium.

1177
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,727
Now, did you cook all this up
so I would come out,

1178
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,064
clean it up,
get Becky off the hook?

1179
01:29:58,066 --> 01:29:59,966
Is that what you did?

1180
01:29:59,968 --> 01:30:02,737
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1181
01:30:05,006 --> 01:30:07,908
A mother will do anything
to protect her daughter.

1182
01:30:09,577 --> 01:30:11,579
Tell me that
you did it, Jayne.

1183
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:14,015
It might make you feel better.

1184
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:16,884
Mama,
what's going on?

1185
01:30:22,624 --> 01:30:24,192
Did you kill
my husband, Mama?

1186
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:28,662
Tell her, Jayne.

1187
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:31,065
Mama.

1188
01:30:40,574 --> 01:30:42,540
He was a monster.

1189
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:43,777
He would've killed you.

1190
01:30:44,577 --> 01:30:46,247
He would've killed you.

1191
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:51,185
Sweetheart.

1192
01:30:54,888 --> 01:30:58,157
I knew I wasn't gonna
be around to protect you.

1193
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,694
There was no other way
to save you, honey.

1194
01:31:08,034 --> 01:31:09,837
I'm so sorry.

1195
01:31:17,077 --> 01:31:21,713
<i>In 1971, scientists
predicted that a comet named Kohoutek</i>

1196
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:25,718
<i>would pass closer to Earth than
any other heavenly body in history.</i>

1197
01:31:26,953 --> 01:31:30,187
<i>Timothy Leary said it was
a cosmic windshield wiper</i>

1198
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:33,726
<i>that would wash this planet
clean of all its bad karma.</i>

1199
01:31:35,628 --> 01:31:38,062
<i>The hippies waited
with baited breath,</i>

1200
01:31:38,064 --> 01:31:40,598
<i>but '71 came and went.</i>

1201
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,002
<i>Somehow, Kohoutek
veered off into space.</i>

1202
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,144
<i>They say we'll have to wait another
thousand years for it to return.</i>

1203
01:31:52,378 --> 01:31:55,214
<i>Till then, someone else will
have to deal with all this shit.</i>

1204
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,059
<i>To say goodbye
is to die a little.</i>

1205
01:32:10,129 --> 01:32:12,031
<i>I wasn't quite ready for that.</i>

1206
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,991
<i>I wasn't in a hurry to go home.</i>

1207
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:49,301
<i>Then I realized,
I already was.</i>
